        I plan on documenting my drone experince here with photos and flight videos. As of now I am waiting on my
            drone to come in the mail. I ordered it from banggood and it was supposed to arrive a week ago. Once I get the drone 
            in I will be able to see if everything works together. Hopefully it does.

            </h2>
            <p>
                These goggles were a no brainer for the price. The goggles are one of the lowest priced goggles that have DVR capability.
                DVR enables you to record your flights and I wanted this feature so I could record my flight progress and see how I grow throughout
                my drone flying experinces! Another benefit to these goggles is that even though they are bulky they can be split into two pieces
                so you can have a friend view the live feed with you! For the price these goggles have a lot to offer.

                FS-i6x: Dual Protocol Decision
            </h2>
            <p>
                The reason I chose this transmitter is because of the versatility the controller offers. It
                has the ability to switch protocols - which enables me to grow with the controller and it prevents
                lockdowns to specific brands. The protocols are AFHDS and AFHDS2 which are used by flysky controllers.
            </p>

            </h2>
            <p>I choose this drone because it works with the transmitter I got and it came preassembled, which I wanted for my first drone.
            I took the same philosphy that you see with car enthusists and decided that having a working model to modify will be better start to the
            hobby rather than building a drone from the start(which could lead to multiple assembly problems possibly leading to a fruitless setup). 
            This quad seemed to have enough punch and the frame gives the rotors durability (and saftey) as it has a guard. If I wanted to build a new quad
            I could salvage parts like the camera and frame too.
